                        The Mir Space Station was designed and built by the Soviet Union and the first core module of the station was launched into orbit in 1986. Its design concept was a culmination of the knowledge gained from the Salyut program. The Mir station was the first to use the modular design concept, which is still in use on the International Space Station today. Because the station was modular in design, each module could be designedfor a specific purpose giving the station greater range of use. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Mir station became property of Russia in 1991 and was operated under the Russian Space Agency Roscosmos.

                        The Mir station was build entirely for scienceresearch and its name translates into "peace", thus there was a great deal of cooperation between Russia and other countries in utilizing the station. Because of growing international cooperation, the station was also utilized by the United States, Japan,as well as European countries, Syria, India, Cuba, and many more. The Mir Program involved a great deal of cooperation between the Russian Space Agency and NASA's Shuttle Program. A number of shuttle missions were to the Mir station sometimes with RussianCosmonauts on board the shuttles

                        As structural and technical problems began to plague the station, the decision was made to decommission it. On January 24, 2001 the booster rockets were fired pushing the station into a controlled re-entry where the station fell into the Southern Pacific Ocean. Mir proved that productive cooperation between nations was possible. The Mir stated out as a Soviet project at the start of its life and after 15 years in orbit was visited by 104 different crew members from 12 different countries making it a tribute to international cooperation which would lead to one of the largest international projects in history
