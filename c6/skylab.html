                        Following the moon missions, the exploration focus shifted to establishing an orbital space laboratory capable of accommodating teams of astronaut scientists. Skylab was launched on May 14, 1973 giving astronauts' 10,000 cubic feet of habitable living space within the facility. Skylab had a rocky start following its launch. During the launch process the heat shield which would shield Skylab from the direct heat of the sun was ripped off. In the process the heat shield breaking off, the solar panel which would provide power to the lab was damaged. As aresult of the damages the lab sustained on launch, it was not fully known if it would be possible to save the lab. A new heat shield was manufactured and was sent up on a repair mission and installed only the lab. Once the new heat shield was installed the internal temperature of the lab dropped from the 130s to the mid 80s and the astronauts were then able to repair the solar panel to getting the station up to full power.

                        Skylab's crew consisted of a commander, pilot, and a science pilot. Three different crews worked on board the lab. The first stayed for 28 days, the second for 59 days, and the last for 84 days. Skylab proved that humans could successfully live and work in space for long periods of time. In 1978 NASA engineers discovered that Skylab's orbit was slowing and the lab would soon fall back to Earth. It would have been possible to boost the lab into a higher orbit thus extending the life of the station, but NASA eventually decided to decommission the station so it could focus more of its resources on the new space shuttle program. On July 11, 1979 NASA fired Skylab's booster rockets sending into the atmosphere where is disintegrated over the Indian Ocean and Australia
