                <p>
                        he SalyutProgram consisted of a series of temporary space station laboratory outputs by the Soviet Union. In total there were 7 Salyutstations placed in low earth orbit. The Salyut1 was the first space station laboratory in the history of space exploration. It was the first orbital laboratory capable supporting life for a sustained period of time. The Salyutwas not without its challenges. Because of a problem with the docking mechanism, the first crew was unable to board the station. The second crew was able to board and spent 23 days on board. However on re-entry, a pressure value opened on the return capsule which resulted in the deaths of the crew.

                        Salyut2 was intended to be a military station, but due to problems with the launch the station only stayed in orbit for a little over a month and was never occupied. Salyut3 was also a military station and was successfully launched. The station eventually fell back to earth on January 24, 1975                </p>

                        Each successive Salyutstation built on what was learned from the previous resulting in longer orbit and occupation times. Salyut7 was the final station in the Salyutprogram. It orbit from 1982 to 1991 and was the predecessor to the Mir Space Station. Two additional modules were built for the Solute station, but the Soviet Union was developing the Mir station at the time and because of problems starting to occur with the Salyut, the two modules intended for the Salyutbecame part of the Mir Station
