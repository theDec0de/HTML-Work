                        Following the fall of Nazi Germany the United States and Soviet Union both sought after a common prize... Wernhervon Braun. Von Braun was considered the best in the field of rocket science and was the developer of the V2 rocket. The V2 had a very short range by today's standards, but was the first rocket to reach space. Von Braun surrendered to the United States andagreed to use his knowledge of rocket science to develop the American space program. The Soviet Union was able to acquire much of Von Braun's documentation, and with that they were able to create the first intercontinental missile capable of travelling over 4000 miles from the USSR to Washington DC. Despite Von Braun's expertise in rocket science he was kept out of the rocket development program because of his Nazi affiliation during the war.

                        On October 4, 1957 the Soviet Union launched Sputnik which was the first man made satellite to orbit the earth. This was the event that struck fear into the minds of many Americans. It was the first time in history that any location in the United States mainland was vulnerable to attack by the Soviet Union. In responsethe United States Navy developed and attempted to launch its own satellite called Vanguard which exploded on the launch pad. With this event, the US Government made the decision to bring Von Braun into the space program and 5 weeks later the US launched its first successful satellite called Jupiter C

                        Yuri Gagarin was launched on April 12, 1961 by the Soviet Union making him the first man in space. However on May 5, 1961 Alan Sheppard became first American into space. Americans were tired of coming in second to the Soviet therefore John F. Kennedy declared that the United States would be the first to make it to the Moon and Von Braun's talents were utilized in the development of the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo programs. On July 20th, 1969 Apollo 11 landed on the moon making Neil Armstrong the first person to set foot on the moon. At this point the United States pulled ahead of the Soviet Union

                        The Soviet's answer to the US Saturn rocket program was the N1 rocket. Unfortunately their first test launch exploded upon its launch ultimately ending the race for the moon for the Soviet Union. Upon reaching the moon, the next goal was orbital outposts, or space stations, was set into motio
