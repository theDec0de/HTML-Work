                <p>
                        In 1982 NASA began to work on the conceptual design of a new space station. The initial purpose of the idea for the station was to serve as an outpost for additional moon mission and missions to other planets known as the International Space Station, ISS. Canada was the first country approached to participate in the project followed by the European countries, and eventually Japan was brought on board. The Soviet Union was at the beginnings of the Mir program therefore were not involved. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States suggested to the participating countries that Russia be brought in on the project as well. All participating countries agreed that Russia should participate so a joint invitation by the United States, Canada, Japan, and Europe was extended 1993 and was accepted by the Russian Government making them an official part of the program

                        Each participating country was responsible for funding and for different aspects of the construction and assembly process. The first module of the ISS was launched on November 20, 1998. Two weeks later the US module was launched into orbit and the Russian and US modules were attached together. Construction on the space station has continued with additional modules still scheduled to be added.

                        The crew consists of 6 astronaut/scientists from participating countries where they participate in various educational programs as well as scientific experiments multiple fields, including biology, physical science, astronomy, meteorology, and medicine. The ISS is the largest man made object and the longest inhabited orbital object ever made. Recently a live feed camera was installed on the ISS allowing visitors to view the Earth from the station.
