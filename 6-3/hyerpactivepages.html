                    Web site designers of the 90s loved animation. It wasnew and fun, and gave pizzazz to an otherwise static web site. Many early web pages had so many animated elements they wouldmake one dizzy by just reading them. Many web designers  wanted too much to incorporate multimedia into their  web pages that it ended  up causing  problems. In the 90s, most people accessed the Internet via dialup, which was slow and costly. It was out of the question to incorporate video orstreaming multimedia, so various low-quality animations were included to add a since of multimedia to a web page

                    One feature of HTML was its ability to scrollor blink text. The marquee tag was used by designers to make the content on their pages animate. The animated content usually made the content difficult to read. Animated and scrolling text is always going to draw attention, even if away from the main page content, and it can be distracting, therefore it should be used sparingly if at all.

                    Animated gifs  were  used  before  Flash  to  give  a  since  of  interaction  to  a  web  page,  even  though  the  images  did  not interact  with the  visitor, they simply moved on the screen. The problem with animated gifs is they are distracting, are larger in size, and serve no real purpose.  As Flashwas introduced, the use  of animated gifs faded, but  are still  used from time to time on web pages today

                    As new thingscame onthe scene, such as animated gifs, flash, JavaScript, designers thought it was fascinating and wanted to include it  in their web site. While the features mentioned on this page may seem fun to use, it is generally accepted  among  professional  designers  that  incorporating  animated  gifs  or  animated  text  is  a  poor  design  technique and is best to avoid such elements
