                    n the early days of the Internet, if you wanted to get online, you subscribed to a dial-up Internet Service Provider (ISP). Even  though  it  was  slow  it  was  still  fascinating  because  it  was  a  new  technology  that  brought  the  world  to  your fingertips! Right from  your  computer  you could get up-to-date news, election results, and even play games with other people far away.

                    In  1989,  Tim  Burners-Lee  invented  the  World  Wide  Web  and  HTML.  Little  did  he  know  that  his  invention  would revolutionize how the world communicates. It did not take long for the telecommunication industry to capitalize on his invention  when  it  was  introduced  to  the  public.  The  early  to  mid  1990s  was  a  development  age  for  the  World  Wide Web.  It  was  new  and  most  people  did  not  exactly  know  how  to  use  it  for  any  meaningful  purpose,  and  some  were apprehensive to make purchases over the Internet

                    However the nerds and geeks saw the web as an exciting new invention and jumpedon board figuring out new ways to utilize  its  power.  Most  people  were  figuring  out  how  to  create  web  pages,  and  it  seemed  like  small  businesses  and individuals  alike  had  to  have  their  own  personal  web  site  hosted  on  one  of  the  many  free  hosting  services  that  were available, many of which have since gone to the bone yard of Internet startups.
