            <p>
                It is easy enough to be pleasant,When life flows like a song,<br><br>

                But the man worth while is one who will smile,When everything goes dead wrong. <br> <br>

                And the smile that is worth the praises of earth,Is the smile that shines through tears <br><br>

                It is easy enough to be prudent,When nothing temps you to stray <br> <br>

                When without or within no voice or sin,Is luring your soul away <br> <br>

                But it's only a negative virtueUntil it is tried by fire <br> <br>

                Andthe life that is worth the honor on earth,Is the one that resists desire <br> <br>

                By the cynic, the sad, the fallen,Who had no strength for the strife. <br> <br>

                The world's highway is cumbered to-day,They make up the sum of life <br> <br>

                But the virtue that conquers passion,And the sorrow that hides in a smile <br> <br>

                t is for these that are worth the homage on earthFor we find them but once in a while
