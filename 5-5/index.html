                When you get what you want in your struggle for selfAnd the world makes you king for a day,Just go to the mirror and look at yourself,And see what that man has to say<br><br>

                For it isn't your father or mother or wife,Who's judgment upon you must pass;The fellow whose verdict counts most in your lifeIs the one staring back from the glass<br><br>

                He's the fellow to please, never mind all the rest.For he's with you clear up to the end,And you've passed the most dangerous, difficult testIf the man in the glass is your friend<br><br>

                You may fool the whole world down the pathway of years.And get pats on the back as you pass,But your final reward will be the heartaches and tearsIf you've cheated the name in the glass
