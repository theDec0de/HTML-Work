                When things go wrong, as they sometimes will,When the road you are trudging seems all uphill,When the funds are low and the debts are high,And you want to smile, but you have to sigh,When care is pressing you down a bit,Rest, if you must, but don't quit!<br><br>

                Live is queer with its twists and turns,As every one of us sometimes learns,And many a failure turns about,When he might have won had he stuck it out;Don't give up, though the pace seems slow,You might succeed withanother blow.<br><br>

                Success is failure turned inside out,The silver tint of clouds of the doubt,And you can never tell how close you are,It may be near when it seems so afar;So stick to thefight when you are hardest hit,It's when things get worse that you mustn'tquit!
