                <p style="text-align: justify">
                    tyle Sheets, or Cascading Style Sheets, are a very powerful tool for the web site developer. They allow you to take control over the look and feel of the web pages andto create a consistent design, layout, and color scheme throughout  your  entire  site.  The  capabilities  of  style  sheets  have  expanded  greatly  over  the  years  giving  the designer  much  more  control  over  the  appearance  of  their  sites.  Originally  when  HTML  was  first  invented,  style was not a consideration therefore tags were added into later releases of HTML that could add style and color to a web  site,  but  the  purpose  of  HTML  was  to  define  the  structure  of  the  page,  not  to  incorporate  style.  Eventually Style  Sheets  were  released  as  a  tool  to  incorporate  style  into  a  web  site  and  to  take  away  the  styling  duties  of HTML.  As  Style  Sheets  became  more  and  more  powerful,  many  of  the  non-structural  HTML  tags  became obsolete  and  some  current  browser  releases  have  even  stopped  recognizing  them  altogether.  Cascading  Style Sheets can be applied to a web site at three different levels:

            <article style="width: 650px;">
                <dl>
                    <dt><strong>External style sheet</strong></dt>
                    <dd>External Style Sheets allow you to create a master style file where you can define all the styles for your entireweb site. Any styles that are used on multiple pages of a website should be defined on the external style sheet. The external style sheet is attached to a web page using the link tab</dd>

                    <dt><strong>Emebedded style sheet</strong></dt>
                    <dd>
                        An embedded style sheet should include styles that only apply to a single page. Any styles that are only used on one page should not be included on the external style sheet because it increases the size of the style sheet and is unnecessarily loaded by all the other pages of your site.
                    </dd>

                    <dt><strong>Inline style sheet</strong></dt>
                    <dd>
                        An inline style sheet is used to add a style to a specific tag as an attribute. The inline style will only work on the tag it is applied to and will not affect any other tags
